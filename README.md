## 📝 Description:
* Analyzing credit scoring data using various regression models (Ridge, Lasso, logistic regression) and a Neural Network model.
  
*  It highlights the techniques employed (regression and Neural Networks) and the domain of application (credit scoring).

## ⌛ Dataset:
* The dataset consists of financial metrics related to various companies, potentially sourced from their financial statements or annual reports.
  
*  Each row represents a different company, and each column represents a specific financial attribute or performance metric.
